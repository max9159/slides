# Private Cloud

---

## Issues

1. Slow for applying resource and adjust settings
1. Unable to know all Servers/Applications status instantly
1. Difficult to build new environment

Note:

- Difficult to build new environment - 1~2 day(s)
  - Apply new server required effort for finding last apply info and reinstall every software and settings
  - Although VM image template could achieve the same goal, MIS is unable to maintain all BU's image. By using private cloud IT could maintain their own image in version control
- Slow for applying resource and adjust settings - MIS-1241 (5 days),  MIS-1230 (1 month)
  - too many processes (Finding document, inaccurate assessment, Approve flow, Server spec adjustment multiple times, firewall....)
  - Limited resource and free but unreleased resource lead to tight assessment and bargain. It caused more repeated flow
- Unable to know Server/Application status 
  - e.g. After QAT deployment required one by one manually check
